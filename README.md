# Student Engagement Detection Using a Custom Object Detection Model with YOLOv5

Monitoring student's engagement in a class is important for teachers to maximise how effective their teaching methods and to optimize the student's learning experiences. Normally, this task has relied on observations of the teachers while on the same time maintaining to teach the materials, making it hard for the teacher to focus. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to automate the process of student engagement detection, providing help for the teachers with accurate observation.
